This Python project computes the shortest flight route between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. It leverages open data from the OpenFlights dataset to calculate distances between airports and provides estimated flight times for the shortest route.

Features:
- Load airport and route data directly from the OpenFlights dataset.
- Build a flight network graph based on real-world airport locations and routes.
- Efficiently compute the shortest path between two cities using an optimized Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Display:
    Total flight distance (in kilometers and miles).
    Estimated flight time (in hours).
    Detailed route information with airport codes, cities, and countries.
